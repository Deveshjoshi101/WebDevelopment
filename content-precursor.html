<h2>The Precursor to the Web (Pre-1990s)</h2>
<p>
  1960s and 1970s: The foundations of the internet were laid during this period.
  The U.S. Department of Defense initiated ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects
  Agency Network), a research project to develop a decentralized communication
  network.

<p>
  1980s: ARPANET evolved, and other networks like CSNET (Computer Science
  Network) and BITNET (Because It's Time Network) emerged. These networks
  allowed academic and research institutions to communicate and share resources.

  1989: Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist working at CERN (European
  Organization for Nuclear Research), proposed the concept of a "hypertext
  project" to facilitate information sharing among scientists.
